Zsh
===
The Z shell (zsh) is a Unix shell that can be used as an interactive login shell and as a powerful command interpreter for shell scripting. Zsh can be thought of as an extended Bourne shell with a large number of improvements, including some features of bash, ksh, and tcsh.

Origin
======
The first version of zsh was written by Paul Falstad in 1990 when he was a student at Princeton University. The name zsh derives from Yale professor Zhong Shao's (then a teaching assistant at Princeton University) name â€” Paul Falstad thought that Shao's login name, "zsh", was a good name for a shell. The American English pronunciation of Z is "zee", so Z shell rhymes with C shell, which is a homophone of seashell.

Features
========
- Programmable command-line completion that can help the user type both options and arguments for most used commands, with out-of-the-box support for several hundred commands
- Sharing of command history among all running shells
- Extended file globbing allows file specification without needing to run an external program such as find
- Improved variable/array handling
- Editing of multi-line commands in a single buffer
- Spelling correction
- Various compatibility modes, e.g. zsh can pretend to be a Bourne shell when run as /bin/sh
- Themeable prompts, including the ability to put prompt information on the right side of the screen and have it auto-hide when typing a long command
- Loadable modules, providing among other things: full TCP and Unix domain socket controls, an FTP client, and extended math functions
- Fully customizable
